# hj-comp-challenge-1

The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep students working with HTML/CSS. We were asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, we were given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Students had a bit of creative license, however the objective was to build something that respects the integrity of the original design.
